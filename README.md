playing with vlang


Agetest
Just a random script to check if two users can "register" based on their ages. No practical use besides learning vlang.

usage: ./agetest register --name peter --age 18

result:

[+] peter is 18 old
[+} nisse can register

If age is less than 18:

[+] peter is 17 old
[+} nisse cannot register
